## üíº Business Case and Requirement

You are a Data Analyst working for an e-commerce company named X. You are tasked with preparing a presentation to present an overview of the company's business and operations to date for Sales and Operations Managers. 

### The presentation should include at a minimum the following information: 
- Sale business and Products, Store overview. 
- Demographics, customers overview.

### Some additional information for the case study:
- The business database based on The Contoso BI Demo dataset is used to demonstrate DW/BI functionalities across the entire Microsoft Office product family. This dataset includes C-level, sales/marketing, IT, and common finance scenarios for the retail industry and support map integration. In addition, this dataset offers large volumes of transactions from OLTP and well-structured aggregations from OLAP, along with reference and dimension data.
- Since this is a virtual database, numbers such as revenue, costs... are also symbolic. But it does not affect the mining process, data analysis and conclusions for the report
- The Sale bussiness in this case just run from 2007 to 2009.

## üìÇ Datasets
### Introduce about the dataset
- Database Contoso is an example database created by Microsoft to help learn and develop applications in the Microsoft SQL Server environment. It is used as a sample dataset to showcase Microsoft Business Intelligence products and DW/BI capabilities across the entire Microsoft Office product family.
- The dataset includes information about the company's departments such as C-levels, Sales/Marketing, IT, Finance and supports map integration, providing both OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical) data Processing), along with reference data and dimensions.
The Contoso database consists of tables such as Customer, Order, OrderDetail, and Product, each containing different information about the company's customers, orders, order details, and products. These tables have relationships with each other, allowing for complex and efficient data queries. For example, a customer can have many different orders, and each order can have many different line items.
- These data can be used for data analysis, visualization, and training of predictive and classification models. In education, Contoso is often used as an example to teach concepts in many areas such as databases, application development, and systems management.
