- Welcome to the sales dashboard report for an eCommerce company from a virtual database from Microsoft. In this report, I'll explore the key metrics and trends that shape our sales performance. Let's dive in!

- Starting with the scorecard, I can see impressive numbers that reflect the strength of our sales performance. I achieved significant sales (**$4 billion**), served a large customer base (**19 thousand**), processed many orders (**3 million**), operated across multiple stores (**306**) with a large volume of customers. goods are traded significantly (**53 million units of goods**) and sales are conducted in many different countries (**35 countries**). These numbers demonstrate the size and scope of our business.

- For now, let's focus on our top performers. Looking at the bar graph, I able to identify the products, customers, and stores that contributed the most to our sales. Our top 5 products have consistently demonstrated outstanding performance, driving significant revenue and customer engagement. Likewise, I have a loyal group of customers who consistently choose our services, which has a significant impact on our sales figures. In addition, certain stores have emerged as major contributors, attracting a large number of customers and generating substantial sales revenue.

- When I analyze the date-time line chart, an interesting pattern emerges. I observe that our sales are consistently at their highest during the 4th and 1st quarters of each year. This trend indicates that these quarters play an important role in our overall sales performance. But when observing the in orders trend, there is a downward trend from the beginning of 2008 to the end of 2009, i'm going to explain detail why in the Orders and Products dashboard report.
  
- In summary, this sales dashboard report provides a comprehensive overview of our performance. I've seen impressive numbers across a variety of metrics, and our top performers drive our success. Sales patterns identified in Q4 and 1 provide us with valuable insights for future strategic planning and development. By leveraging the strengths of our best performers and taking advantage of peak seasons, and by recognizing weaknesses in order growth, I can further accelerate growth. sales and maintain its competitive advantage.

- First I achieved significant sales  (**$4 billion**), Costs account for **25%** of total sale (**$1 billion**) and Profit (**$3 billion**) so the gross margin is estimately **81,68%**, this can be considered a good result when compare it with industry benchmarks and the performance of similar E commerce companies. But I think we can still increase revenue by optimizing the following 2 metrics, two of last scorecard show the amount of many products returned from customer (**$33,16 million**) and amount from various of discount and promotion (**$752,72 million**).
- Second im going to analyze detail 3 metric Sale, Cost, Profit through the time by line chart. I observe that our sales are consistently at their highest during the 4th and 1st quarters of each year, the pie chart show sale by months proved it. It can be attributed to various factors such as the holiday season, increased consumer spending or successful marketing campaigns during these times, or customers are attracted to policies. promotions (I will explain more in the report on promotion policy). Understanding this pattern allows us to take advantage of these peak seasons and optimize our strategies accordingly. Next is ReturnedAmount and DiscountAmount through the time by line chart. It showed to me at what times the value of returned products is high or low, from there we need to find out which products are returning the most from customers to improve the things that need improvement from those products, i'm going to explain detail on Orders and Products dashboard part .
- Third As i said in the Overall dashboard part, the Orders trend is downward in 2008 and 2009. But when i look at the pie chart show sale by years, the sale of 3 years is almost the same, This shows that although there are less orders in 2008 and 2009 than in 2007, the quantity of goods in each order must be much higher, and often the customer will be the exchange goods representative of big companies.
- Fouth is the table that show detail about total sale and growthing percentage  by year and quarter, with the highest is **340,47%** from quarter2 2007 to quarter3 2007 and lowest is down **-95,55%** from quarter1 2007 to quarter2 2007
