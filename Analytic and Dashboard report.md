- Welcome to the sales dashboard report for an eCommerce company from a virtual database from Microsoft. In this report, I'll explore the key metrics and trends that shape our sales performance. Let's dive in!

- Starting with the scorecard, I can see impressive numbers that reflect the strength of our sales performance. I achieved significant sales (**$4 billion**), served a large customer base (**19 thousand**), processed many orders (**3 million**), operated across multiple stores (**306**) with a large volume of customers. goods are traded significantly (**53 million units of goods**) and sales are conducted in many different countries (**35 countries**). These numbers demonstrate the size and scope of our business.

- For now, let's focus on our top performers. Looking at the bar graph, I able to identify the products, customers, and stores that contributed the most to our sales. Our top 5 products have consistently demonstrated outstanding performance, driving significant revenue and customer engagement. Likewise, I have a loyal group of customers who consistently choose our services, which has a significant impact on our sales figures. In addition, certain stores have emerged as major contributors, attracting a large number of customers and generating substantial sales revenue.

- When I analyze the date-time line chart, an interesting pattern emerges. I observe that our sales are consistently at their highest during the 4th and 1st quarters of each year. This trend indicates that these quarters play an important role in our overall sales performance. It can be attributed to various factors such as the holiday season, increased consumer spending or successful marketing campaigns during these times, or customers are attracted to promotions policies (I will explain more in the report on promotion policy part). Understanding this pattern allows us to take advantage of these peak seasons and optimize our strategies accordingly.

- By connecting the dots betIen our top performers and observed sales patterns, I gain valuable insights. For example, I can identify which products drove sales during peak quarters and tailor our marketing efforts around them. I can also analyze stores that have attracted a higher number of customers during these times and explore opportunities to replicate their success in other locations.

- In summary, this sales dashboard report provides a comprehensive overview of our performance. I've seen impressive numbers across a variety of metrics, and our top performers drive our success. Sales patterns identified in 4th and 1st quarters provide us with valuable insights for future strategic planning and development. By leveraging the strengths of our top performers and taking advantage of peak seasons, I can further accelerate sales growth and maintain our competitive edge.
