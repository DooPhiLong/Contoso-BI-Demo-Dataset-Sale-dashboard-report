# Data mining and cleaning

Because this is a virtual database created from Microsoft to support the practice of analysis. So the data from the tables are mostly cleaned and there are no errors in data such as formatting, spelling, meaning, and especially empty cells have their own meaning, not due to missing data
## ðŸ”¨ Tool : SQL sever, Power BI and Power query 
## ðŸ“Œ Add DATA from SQL sever to Power BI
<details><summary> Step 1 </summary>
Connect with SQL sever database
